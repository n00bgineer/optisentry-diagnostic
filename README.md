# OptiSentry Diagnostic Server

![OptiSentry Application](https://res.cloudinary.com/dgu9rv3om/image/upload/v1691673076/optisentry/report_light_desktop.png)

**OptiSentry** is an open-source application performance and security monitoring system. Currently, for any given web application, it generates a report consisting of two parts:

1. Performance analysis, which contains the web application's performance report generated against one of OptiSentry's diagnostic servers running on a cloud instance deployed at a specific location (e.g., Singapore, London, Oregon, N. Virginia). The performance analysis is conducted using Google's `lighthouse` tool running on a headless browser of the rendering engine (i.e. webkit, chromium or firefox) or viewports of your choice.
2. Security analysis (WIP)

This repository contains the diagnostic server for the OptiSentry system. The **diagnostic server** generates the performance & security report for an application on a cloud instance deployed.
